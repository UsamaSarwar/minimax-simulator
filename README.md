## Introduction
The Minimax Simulator is a project that demonstrates the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence and game theory. Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.

## Features
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning.
- Visual representation of the algorithm.
- Interactive user interface.

## Usage
You can use the Minimax Simulator live at [Minimax Simulator](https://usamasarwar.github.io/minimax-simulator/).

## How It Works
The Minimax algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning works as follows:

1. **Minimax Algorithm**: The algorithm evaluates all possible moves in a game to determine the best move for the player. It assumes that the opponent will also play optimally.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: This optimization technique reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision.
